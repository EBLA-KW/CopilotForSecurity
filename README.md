# Copilot for Security

Microsoft Copilot for Security is a generative AI-powered security solution that helps increase the efficiency and capabilities of defenders to improve security outcomes at machine speed and scale, while remaining compliant to responsible AI principles.

Copilot for Security provides a natural language, assistive copilot experience that helps support security professionals in end-to-end scenarios such as incident response, threat hunting, intelligence gathering, and posture management.

The solution leverages the full power of OpenAI architecture to generate a response to a user prompt by using security-specific plugins, including organization-specific information, authoritative sources, and global threat intelligence. By using plugins as data point sources, security professionals have wider visibility into threats and gain more context, and have the opportunity to extend the solutionâ€™s functionalities. For more about plugins, read Manage plugins.

Designed with integration in mind, Copilot for Security seamlessly integrates with products in the Microsoft Security portfolio such as Microsoft Defender XDR, Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft Intune, as well as other third-party services such as ServiceNow.
